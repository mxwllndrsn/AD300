BINARY TREES
============

#### A directed, acyclic structure of linked nodes

Features *one way links between nodes*. **Acyclic** as no path wraps back to same node twice. Each node ahs at most **two** children. 
A tree can be defined as `null`, or a single `root` node that contains `data` and both left and right subtrees, *both of which could be **null*** but must be present. 

A *list, stack or queue* is a **linear structure** that consists of a sequence of elements. A **Binary Tree** is a hierarchal structure. 

Trees rely on a combination of linked lists and recursive methods. 

##### Terminology

  - **Node** an object containing a data val and children
  - **Root** topmost node of a tree
  - **Leaf** a node that has no children
  - **Branch** any internal node, neither root nor leaf
  - Also **Parent, Child, Sibling**
  - **Full Tree** A tree in which every branch has 2 children
  - **Subtree** a tree of nodes reachable to the left/right from the current node 

##### Tree Nodes

```java
public class TreeNode{
	public int data;
	public TreeNode left;
	public TreeNode right;

	// construct leaf
	public TreeNode(int data){
		this(data, null, null);
	}
	// construct branch 
	public TreeNode(int data, TreeNode left, TreeNode right){
		this.data = data;
		this.left = left;
		this.right = right;
	}
}
```

Methods of IntTree create and manipulate nodes, implemented:

```java
public class IntTree{
	private TreeNode root;

	public type name(param){
		name(root, param);
	}

	private type name(TreeNode root, param){
		...
	}

	// create tree and fill with nodes
	public IntTree(int max){
		
}
```

Tree methods are implemented recursively with a public/private pair as interface. Private constructor accepts the *root node* for internal access.
Client code such as `IntTree tree = new IntTree(7);` will call a new tree object with 7 nodes. 

#### Sequential Tree

An ordered tree with 1st level, 2/3 2nd level, 4/5/6/7 3rd level. 
With a sequential tree where n = 1, child nodes (or next level) accessed as `left = 2n` & `right = 2n+1`.

Construction:

```java

public IntTree(int max){
	if(max<=0)
		throw new IllegalArgumentException("max: " + max);
	root = buildTree(1, max);
}
// return seqtree w/ root n  unless > max
private TreeNode buildTree(int n, int max){
	if(n>max)
		return null;
	else {
		TreeNode left = buildTree(2*n, max);
		TreeNode right = buildTree(2*n+1, max);
		return new TreeNode(n, left, right);
	}
}
// more succinctly return new TreeNode(n, buildTree(2*n, max), buildTree(2*n+1, max));

```

#### Traversal

**Pre-Order** root, left, right

**In-Order** left, root, right

**Post-Order** left, right, root
