Recursion
----------

*A recursive method invokes itself directly or indirectly.*
  - Equally powerful substitue for iteration (loops)
  - Excels in cases where simple iteration is insufficient 
  - Requires decomposing problem into simplest case (or base case)

When the recursive method is called with the **base case**, it returns the result.
The recursive function divides complex cases into a known base case and a complex-1 case (or **recursive case**). 
The sequence of reduced complexity must eventually converge on the base case. 
A sequence of returns is then initiated until the initial invocation is reached.

Example: Calculating Factorial

*The factorial of a nonnegative integer n, written **n!**
pronounced n-factorial is the product:

```math
n*(n-1)*(n-2)*..*1
```
**e.g. 5! is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120**
